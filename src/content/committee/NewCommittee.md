In order to add a new committee (or indeed, a new committee member), follow the steps below:

1. Create a new folder in the format of: `<committee start year>-<committee end year>` (i.e 2025-2026)
2. Within this folder add new markdown (.md) files, with the __*name*__ of the committee member (i.e joe.md),<br/> 
and a photo of the committee member in __png__ format (i.e joe.png)
3. Within this markdown file, copy and paste the following:
```
---
name:
role:
favourite_game:
bio:


importance:
---
```
4. Fill in the fields that you just copied in (watch for spellings, grammar, etc).
5. Lastly, set the importance value based on the seniority of the role (1 for president, 2 for secretary, etc)
> Note: If two committee members have the same importance (i.e two tech officers have '4'), it will order alphabetically by first name

Congratulations! You have successfully added a new committee/committee member!<br/>
Don't forget to save your files, rerun the dev server (as explained in the overall README)
