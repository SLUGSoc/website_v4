# Hello!
Congratulations - you are (probably) a new committee member of SLUGSOC (and/or a tech officer)!

If this is your first time reading this please start below:
# First Time
## Running the server
Ensure you have [NodeJS/NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [AstroJS](https://astro.build/) installed. <br/>
Once you have installed AstroJS, navigate to the root of the project in your terminal (i.e <folder>/slugsoc) and run:
```
npm i
```
to install the necessary packages<br />
Once that is done run:
```
npx astro dev
```
(optionally add --host to make it available on your local network for testing across devices)

## Committee / Committee Members
Please read the guide (NewCommittee.md) on adding committee members in the committees/ folder
## Esport
Please read the guide (Esports.md) on adding esports in the esports/ folder
## Events
This is a WIP, but eventually events will be pulled from a Google Calendar, parsed, and then displayed accordingly
