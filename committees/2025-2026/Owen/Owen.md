bio: I’m in my second year of Computer Science and I like playing video games. I like things like House Flipper and BeamNG.Drive, but sometimes play more competitive things like Counter Strike too. When I’m not playing games, I like messing with computers and making them do things they’re not meant to, as well as looking after and maintaining them.
