bio: Hi I'm Jake and I am in my second year of History and Chinese studies. I am a massive fan of the FromSoftware games, if you ever bring it up to me I could bang on about them for hours, I also really enjoy lots of other single player games out there. I am also a huge Overwatch fan and currently captain of one of the University Teams (Sheffield Dragons on Top). I'm always down for a drink and other shenanigans. If you're ever interested in competing for any of our games here at sheffield come talk to me and I can help sort you out!
